# Device Details [![Listed in Awesome YOURLS!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-YOURLS-C5A3BE)](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls/)

A plugin to display information about each click, based on Tacoded's IP Click Details. <br>
Requires Your Own URL Shortener ([YOURLS](https://yourls.org)) `v1.9.2` and above.

## Usage

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Check it out on my own website: [ipgrabber.pro](https://ipgrabber.pro). I use Sleeky's front-end, but the default should work.

## Version 1
This plugin uses WhichBrowser's Parser to display IP, user-agent, device, browser, location, and time.

## Version 2
In addition to everything in version 1, as promised, this update provides more tracked stats.  <br>
Things like device battery, orientation, language, and screen info can be logged with some Javascript.  <br>
However, for this to work, the `functions.php` file needs to be modified, which is not recommended.  <br>
In fact, "hacking" core files is essentially [banned](https://yourls.org/docs/development/dont-hack-core), but I do not know how to do it otherwise. <br>
My modifications are not anything massive. Feel free to check them out on [diffchecker.com](https://www.diffchecker.com/UvnSxpDU/) if desired. <br>
I have also not really tested this super rigorously, so if you find any bugs, feel free to open an issue! <br>
I'm aware that by using cookies to store the data, the data will always be one click behind. 

## Version 3
This version is currently in development. The main change is that it does not "hack" core files. <br>
It still has all of the functionality of the previous version with some added features as well. <br>
Firstly, there is a page under manage plugins that allows you to input your own [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) API token. <br>
Secondly, click data is transferred to the backend with the POST method so it is always accurate. <br>
I will publish it once I have more time to finish programming it but it might take me some time. <br>
If you would like to help me, feel free to open up a new issue as well! I would appreciate any help.

## Installation
1. Install WhichBrowser to the root using `composer require whichbrowser/parser`.
2. It is possible that you will have to change the path of `vendor/autoload.php`.
3. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `device-details`.
4. Choose what version you want (see the two sections above to decide).
5. Download the right `plugin.php` file from this git repo and drop it into step 3's directory.
6. If you use version 2, make sure to also replace `/includes/functions.php` with the provided one.
7. Go to the Plugins admin page (eg. `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php`) and activate it.
8. Even if the admin area is private, you should make the link stats page public.
9. Do this by adding `define('YOURLS_PRIVATE_INFOS', false);` to `config.php`.

I got a request to make this compatible with the [Download Plugin](https://github.com/krissss/yourls-download-plugin) plugin, so I will look more into it. Version 1 should be compatible, although it looks like I need to configure the branches of this repository a little bit differently.
